  Personally, I've had problems using <em>Kendo UI Web</em> date validator: it only works on
  <code>input[type="date"]</code> and since the <em>DatePicker</em> widget
  transforms it's <code>&lt;input></code> element to <code>input[type="text"]</code>,
  you can't use the validator anymore.
</p>

<p>
  Kiui <em>Date</em> validator can be applied to <em>any</em> <code>&lt;input></code> element
  and it just works with <em>DatePicker</em>s. Additionally, you can also specify
  a custom culture that the validator will use when trying to parse the date.
