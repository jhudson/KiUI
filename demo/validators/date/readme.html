  Personally, I've had some problems using <em>Kendo UI Web</em> date validator:
  it only works on <code>input[type="date"]</code> and since the <em>DatePicker</em> widget
  transforms it's <code>&lt;input></code> element to <code>input[type="text"]</code>,
  you can't use the validator anymore.
</p>

<p>
  Kiui <em>Date</em> validator can be applied to <em>any</em> <code>&lt;input></code> element
  and it just works with <em>DatePicker</em>s. Additionally, you can also specify
  a custom culture that the validator will use when trying to parse the date.
</p>

<p>
  To start using the <em>Date</em> validator just add the attribute <code>data-kiui-date</code>
  to an <code>&lt;input></code> element and you're done; the date will be validated
  using every standard format defined for the current default culture.
</p>

<p>
  You can specify a custom format to be used when parsing the date; you can do so
  by setting the attribute value to the desired format, such as
  <code>data-kiui-date="dd-MM-yyyy"</code>. Now <em>only</em> that format will
  be used to parse the date.
</p>

<p>
  You can also specify a custom culture to be used when parsing the date instead
  of the current default one. You can do so by setting the attribute
  <code>data-kiui-date-culture</code> to the desired custom culture. Now <em>only</em>
  the standard formats defined for the custom culture will be used to parse the date.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately there seems to be a bug in <code>kendo.parseDate()</code> and so
  the custom culture that you wish to use must have been set at least once as
  the default culture for the parsing to work correctly. See the Javascript example
  code for a way to do this.
</p>

<p>
  If you specify both a custom format and a custom culture, <em>only</em> the custom
  format will be considered when parsing the date.
