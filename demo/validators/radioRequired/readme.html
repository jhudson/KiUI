  Recently at work I had to implement some form validations; there was this radio
  button that needed to be <em>required</em>. I said to myself: <em>"Nothing easier!!
  I'll just use the standard <code>required</code> Kendo validator"</em>. Unfortunately
  it doesn't support radio buttons. :(
</p>

<p>
  Kiui <em>Radio Required</em> validator extends the standard Kendo required
  validator and makes it work with radio buttons too.
</p>

<p>
  It's not that difficult to use: just go on and put that <code>required</code>
  attribute on your <code>&lt;input type="radio"></code> element and it'll
  <em>just</em> work!
